# Research Project

PhD students or students interested in research may elect to do
a research project instead of Projects 3 and 4. Ideally, this is a project
you would continue to work on past the class, and possibly publish. **Please submit a 
short (2 paragraphs) project proposal by Friday, March 18 if
you plan to do this**. Send to me over e-mail. You may choose your own research
project (pending my approval), but here are some ideas:

- Validate experiments from [LegoOS paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi18-shan.pdf). Explore
other workloads. Port it to another language, evaluate it on different hardware, explore other hardware devices, e.g., FPGAs.
- Explore [Theseus OS](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus), analyze its performance in a virtualized
environment. 
- Explore replication for fault tolerance in the context of virtual subroutines (virtines). See our paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11324). 
- Add language support to [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) to support [virtines](https://github.com/virtines/wasp). 
- Apply [program synthesis](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37365798/HOLLAND-DISSERTATION-2020.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) to 
[virtine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11324) execution environments. 
- Use modern OS and virtualization techniques (e.g., [Theseus](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20/presentation/boos)) to revisit
[microreboot](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi-04/microreboot%E2%80%94-technique-cheap-recovery)
- Explore usage of high-performance I/O in serverless functions. Maybe consider adapting [Demikernel](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477132.3483569)
architecture.
- Extend/improve [J-NVM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3477132.3483579?casa_token=oWvwXW5y5ZwAAAAA:-b6X5Sv4zwzWqF1xlIcLi8VLWAklcJ1HOgi7Y281_Tabs9qnmUvplteaGvR5DNPBbigjhyxZ7OLA)
- Improve stateful serverless computing [over shared logs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477132.3483541) with NVM
- Implement an [MPK-based](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/protection-keys.html) back-end for [virtines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11324)
- Work on/improve/extend a system from [VEE '21](https://conf.researchr.org/program/vee-2021/program-vee-2021/)
